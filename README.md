# Joke Teller

ZTM course project VanillaJS: using the Joke API and a speech-to-text API to
generate jokes into audio speach

# how it works:

- Joke API generates jokes into string
- click Tell Me A Joke! button to generate joke
- Then Speech-to-text API converts string to audio
- also you can read jokes as text, if you can't hear it clearly
- responsive app
